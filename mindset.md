# Getting that Mindset Right 28/04/2020

###  Upgrade Your Tech Skills with Deliberate Practice
The four criteria that must be fulfilled in order to call yourwork deliberate practice: 
    1. Motivation to attend to the task as well as exert effore to improve performance. 
    2. When designing the task you must take into account your previous knowledge. This helps with understanding the instructions so that the task can be correctly understood ith an appropriate level of difficulty.
    3. After your performance you should recieve immediate informative feedback and knowledge of results of your performance. 
    4. Repeat the same or similar tasks. 
#### Peak & Lebron Video Thoughts
- There are no shortcuts to greatness!
I completely agree with this video and what actions are demonstrated to improve. Without motivation and drive there is not much improvement. Especially not if you are simply just showing up and doing what you have always done. *For example,* while we are in lecture I feel the days where I am engaged and 100% into the lecture and focused on the content Keith is teaching, those days I learn vastly more than when I am not 100% present and asking questions no matter how silly they seem. Even if I would go back to rewatch the lecture videos, I still do not get out what I did when I was present **DURING** lecture. Utilizing my time effectively will be key to my success or ultimate failure for 401. Keith and I have spoken during our 1 on 1 time and I remember him saying we are only in DeltaV for so long, this means we need to utilize each and every hour we are here. We need to make sure every moment we are present and fully engaged. 
__________________________________
One thing that could really help me improve more is that I am very competitive, I should really make my everyday tasks (small task by small task) into a little competition for myself and put it on my whiteboard. This way I can visially see my improvement of little wins and have that in my mind that I will beat that number the next day. 
I also agree that there is joy in working on especially when you get to see the improvement from the last day or the last week or complete a big goal. 


### Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset 
Understanding our abilities can be developed. We can praise improvement and the process. 
I  can implement this TED talk into my daily studies by approaching difficult challenges by really researching the base of the problem as well as really embracing the process and improvement of just trying to take on the challenge. I have noticed that I put a lot of pressure on myself for getting everything right and '100%' and just getting through problems instead of slowing down and enjoyingthe process of learning. I will be trying this in 401. 

### Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit
Grit:  Courage and Resolve, Strength of character. The passion and perserverance for longterm goals. 
Taking this TED talk into 401 is to really not give in when this class gets tough, when I run into a hard to deal with classmate, or when I encounter a new problem that I am unsure of. How can I work through those problems more effectively instead of trying to force them out or ignore that they are causing issues or backup?
