# Getting that Mindset Right 28/04/2020

###  Upgrade Your Tech Skills with Deliberate Practice
The four criteria that must be fulfilled in order to call yourwork deliberate practice: 
    1. Motivation to attend to the task as well as exert effore to improve performance. 
    2. When designing the task you must take into account your previous knowledge. This helps with understanding the instructions so that the task can be correctly understood ith an appropriate level of difficulty.
    3. After your performance you should recieve immediate informative feedback and knowledge of results of your performance. 
    4. Repeat the same or similar tasks. 
#### Peak & Lebron Video Thoughts
- There are no shortcuts to greatness!
I completely agree with this video and what actions are demonstrated to improve. Without motivation and drive there is not much improvement. Especially not if you are simply just showing up and doing what you have always done. *For example,* while we are in lecture I feel the days where I am engaged and 100% into the lecture and focused on the content Keith is teaching, those days I learn vastly more than when I am not 100% present and asking questions no matter how silly they seem. Even if I would go back to rewatch the lecture videos, I still do not get out what I did when I was present **DURING** lecture. Utilizing my time effectively will be key to my success or ultimate failure for 401. Keith and I have spoken during our 1 on 1 time and I remember him saying we are only in DeltaV for so long, this means we need to utilize each and every hour we are here. We need to make sure every moment we are present and fully engaged. 
__________________________________
One thing that could really help me improve more is that I am very competitive, I should really make my everyday tasks (small task by small task) into a little competition for myself and put it on my whiteboard. This way I can visially see my improvement of little wins and have that in my mind that I will beat that number the next day. 
I also agree that there is joy in working on especially when you get to see the improvement from the last day or the last week or complete a big goal. 


### Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset 
Understanding our abilities can be developed. We can praise improvement and the process. 
I  can implement this TED talk into my daily studies by approaching difficult challenges by really researching the base of the problem as well as really embracing the process and improvement of just trying to take on the challenge. I have noticed that I put a lot of pressure on myself for getting everything right and '100%' and just getting through problems instead of slowing down and enjoyingthe process of learning. I will be trying this in 401. 

### Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit
Grit:  Courage and Resolve, Strength of character. The passion and perserverance for longterm goals. 
Taking this TED talk into 401 is to really not give in when this class gets tough, when I run into a hard to deal with classmate, or when I encounter a new problem that I am unsure of. How can I work through those problems more effectively instead of trying to force them out or ignore that they are causing issues or backup? 

### Alain de Botton on Redefining Success
Wow, this video really hit the nail on the head. As I said in the notes under Growth Mindset, I find there is a **TON** of pressure.I definitely take what happens very personally, trying to be successful add pressure, not wanting to fail or in last weeks final project not wanting to have an incomplete project was so much added pressure. 
I also agree with Alain on that we never know what someones true value is, and that we should hold our judgements and probably treat everyone as if they have something to add. 

###  Impostor Syndrome
Imposter Syndrome is feeling like a fraud, not as smart, not as capable....etc
Possible solutions: 
    - Make a habit of being uncomfortable
    - Keep track of achievements
    - Make fundamentals clear
    - Get support from seniors

In software development there is so much to know, we just know a tiny sliver of all of the information available. A key to overcoming *imposter syndrome* is not to focus on what you dont know but focus on what you **DO** know. We need to remember that we know a lot, and not knowing something doesnt mean that we are a step behind it just means there is more to learn and everyone has more to learn.

### How to think like a programmer – lessons in problem solving
- Why is problem solving important? 
    - Problem solving is important because it is a meta-skill. A meta-skill is a skill that is reusable and can apply to a wide set of problems.  
I believe this article builds upon the article about Deliberate practice. Building on someones successful problem solving framework, then adaptingit to your own unique style. 

How to problem solve: 
    1. Understand: What is the question asking for for? Can you explain it in plain english/simplest terms? 
    2. Plan: Create a plan of attack, write down the exact steps we need to reach the answer. How do we get there? 
        - “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
    3. Divide: *AGILE ANYONE?* Break the big problem into smaller sub-problems, then start with the simplest one. Build upon that sub problem and connect the dots. 
    4. Stuck: If you get stuck along the way or run into an error utilizedebugging. Go step by step through your program to asses where the problem is. Keith had shown this in 201 and I need to get better at utilizing this in the console. 
    5. Practice: Practice is key to earning how to problem solve. Practicing the same concepts over and over again with the difference types of questions will help solidify the concepts and help you improve your problem solving capabilities.

###  Pretend your time is worth $1000/hour
The quote: 
> “People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.” -William Irvine 
Really resonates with me because sometimes I find it hard to navigate if I should study ore or relax or call a friend or socialize. The more I go through DeltaV the more clear my goals become. I should never have to stress about if I should socialize and take time away from my studies to call a friend that would stop being my frined if I focused on my goals and dreams. My time at DeltaV is so important and people who know me and my goals will see that. I need to bettwe prioritize my time and learn to tell people no. This is one of my weaknesses is saying yes to almost everything. I almost always put people before myself and never think of what is best for my emotional or physical wellbeing or prioritizing my time in general. If I pretended my time was worth $1,000 my life would look immensely different. 
**Maybe during this time all of us could re-evaluate our lives to narrow down what is truly important for us?**

### What I Wish I Knew Before I Learned to Code
- I feel this article is important to reiterate many concepts we have learned throughout 201 and 301 before we dive head first into 401. It is important that each of the students in my class learn differently and that each student can add value to a project because their different approach to the problem and how they know how to solve it. Each student brings their skillset and their talents to a project. Everyone has the ability to contribute.

-  Also, this article points out another concept I have tried to do no matter how silly I feel. This concept is to ask questions, investing in my future by asking the questions that will help me solve problems I face could potentially help othhers later on in solving their own problems. This is also the only way to get the answers to the problems I am personally facing. I should always remember, my questions are really an investment in my own future. 


- Commiting myself to lifelong learning and constant change is one concept I knew coming into the program. Technology is everchanging and rapidly changing so I am up for the challenge and this is one reason I wanted to begin in the tech field. I love constantly learning and finding new ways to do things. So far there have meen many ups and downs to my journey so far but they have all lead me to growth and learning in ways I would have never expected.
